# Soham's Blog

A hybrid static/React blog featuring a terminal-themed interface with interactive elements. Built using static HTML pages from the [toxic static site generator](https://github.com/Sohoxic/toxic) with React routing for clean URLs.

## 🎯 Architecture

This blog uses a **hybrid approach** combining the best of static sites and React:

- **Static HTML Pages**: Fast-loading, SEO-friendly content generated by the toxic static site generator
- **React Router**: Clean URLs and smooth navigation between pages
- **Interactive Elements**: Terminal commands, animations, and hover effects preserved from static HTML
- **Minimal JavaScript**: Only essential React code for routing, keeping the bundle size small

## 🛠 Routes

- **`/`** → Redirects to `/starthere.html` (homepage)
- **`/thesohoxictales`** → Redirects to `/thesohoxictales.html` (blog listing)
- **Static content** served directly from `public/` directory

## ✨ Features

### Homepage (`starthere.html`)
- **Interactive Terminal**: Type commands like `cd blog`, `ls`, `whoami`, `help`, `pwd`, `clear`
- **Timeline Section**: Proof-of-work with personal milestones
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile
- **Terminal Commands**:
  - `cd blog` - Navigate to blog
  - `ls` - List available sections
  - `whoami` - About information
  - `help` - Show available commands
  - `pwd` - present working directory
  - `clear` - Clear terminal history

### Blog Page (`thesohoxictales.html`)
- **Terminal-themed UI**: Consistent with homepage design
- **Mini-blogs**: Quick thoughts, code snippets, book notes
- **Articles**: In-depth posts and tutorials
- **Command-line Style**: File listing with `cat` commands and metadata

## 🚀 Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```

## 🔧 Dependencies

**Runtime:**
- `react` & `react-dom` - For routing components
- `react-router-dom` - Client-side routing

**Development:**
- `vite` - Build tool and dev server
- `typescript` - Type safety
- `tailwindcss` - Utility-first CSS (minimal usage)

## 📝 Content Management

Content is managed through the [toxic by Sohoxic - A static site generator](https://github.com/Sohoxic/toxic):

1. **Write content** in Markdown in the `toxic/content/` directory
2. **Generate static HTML** using `python toxic.py`
3. **Copy generated files** from `toxic/dist/` to `blog/public/`
4. **Deploy** - Vercel automatically builds and deploys

## 🎨 Styling

- **CSS Variables**: Consistent theming across all pages
- **Terminal Theme**: Dark background with syntax highlighting colors
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach
- **Animations**: Smooth transitions and hover effects

## 🚀 Deployment

Deployed on Vercel with automatic builds from the main branch. The `vercel.json` configuration handles client-side routing while serving static assets efficiently.

## 📊 Performance Benefits

- ✅ **Fast Loading**: Static HTML loads instantly
- ✅ **SEO Friendly**: Static content is easily crawlable
- ✅ **Small Bundle**: Minimal React code for routing only
- ✅ **Interactive**: Terminal commands and animations preserved
- ✅ **Clean URLs**: React Router provides `/thesohoxictales` instead of `/thesohoxictales.html`
